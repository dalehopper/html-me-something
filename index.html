    <p>The Vikings were a great sea going people.  They were able to sail farther than any other peoples at the time of their peak.  The Vikings managed to discover America as early as a thousand years before Columbus was even born.  But, this leaves us with something of a mystery.  How did they manage to sail such great distances prior to the introduction of the magnetic compass to the European peoples by the Chinese?  It is true that they could have on clear days simply looked to where the sun was and used some form of a sextant, but at latitudes as far north as Scandinavia, the sun is on most days obscured by a dense cover of clouds making precise sighting of the sun virtually impossible.  There is a growing number of historians who seem to believe that the answer may have been a simple optical device known as the sun stone, a crystal that would elucidate the true location of the sun by taking advantage of the partial polarization of sunlight by the atmosphere and the problematic fog (Karlsen).</p>
    <p>There are several minerals that have been proposed that have properties that may lend themselves to being used in the manner of a sun stone.  The two most common minerals are Lolite (nordskip.com)which changes color differentially with polarized light, and Iceland Spar also known as optical Calcite (Karlsen).  Both minerals are found in regions that the Vikings would have visited.  Lolite is an unlikely candidate in that the crystals found generally would have an irregular shape and would make reproducing navigational calculations with another crystal quite problematic.  Calcite, though has such a regular crystalline structure that it can be cleaved relatively easily to produce smaller crystals with flat sides and angles that precisely match that of the original crystal (Karlsen).  </p>
    <p>It is the birefringence of Calcite that the proposed Sun Stone utilizes to find the location of the sun.  Typically the sun would be obstructed be fog, or low clouds but the area directly above the ship would be clear.  The light coming down from the zenith is mostly polarized in one direction by the scattering of the atmosphere, thus an image viewed through the Sun Stone would be split into two images one more intense than the other based on the orientation of the crystal to the sun (Karlsen).  So, the remaining question is how might the Vikings have put this property of Calcite to work?</p>
    <p>A dark spot would likely have been placed on the center of the top surface of the Sun Stone and then the navigator would have viewed the spot from below using the polarized light from the zenith (Karlsen).  He would have seen two spots that would change in observed intensity as he turned the crystal about a vertical axis.  When the two spots appeared to have equal values a pointer placed along one of the long sides of the crystal would indicate the precise orientation of the sun.  Leif K. Karlsen, the author of Viking Navigation Using the Sunstone, Polarized Light and the Horizon Board reports using this method to find the orientation of the sun during a time of dense fog with an accuracy of to within one degree.  Once the location of the sun was accurately determined navigation could be performed using date and time specific calculations or precalculated charts.</p>
    <p>	It is not clear that the Vikings actually used this method, but it does seem possible that through simple observations of the natural world, that the Vikings could reasonably have discovered this technique.  All of the materials necessary were present, and the weather patterns of the North gave the conditions in which this technique could have been of great value.</p>
    <p>The Sunstone has had recent incarnations, as recently as the 1950â€™s the US Navy and Airforce experimented with its use in navigating near the poles of earth where traditional magnetic compasses were rendered useless (polarization.com).  Reportedly the Scandinavian airlines used a similar idea to navigate its polar flights for several years prior to the advent of global Radar and GPS systems(polarization.com)</p>
